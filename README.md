# CPU-Scheduling-Project
Scheduling CPU alogirthms in an operating system. Algorithms: Priority-based Preemptive Scheduling (PP) Shortest-Remaining-Time-Next Preemptive Scheduling (SRTP) Round-Robin Scheduling (RR). First developed methods that handle arrival of processes for execution and then developed methods of completion of process execution.
